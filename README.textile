h2. GIT tricks I learned by experimenting

*git remote add origin git@github.com:jurgis/test.git*
Then add a line in .git/config under [remote "origin"]
*push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master*

If diff output does not have colors change COMMIT_EDITMSG
type to Diff in TM.

cat .git/config
===============
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@github.com:jurgis/test.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master

Added those lines
[branch "master"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/master
And removed following line
	push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master

And now I want to push and pull the dev branch to the github.
