h2. GIT tricks I learned by experimenting

*git remote add origin git@github.com:jurgis/test.git*

If diff output does not have colors change COMMIT_EDITMSG
type to Diff in TM.

cat .git/config
===============
<pre><code>
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@github.com:jurgis/test.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
</code></pre>

+Added those lines+
<pre><code>
[branch "master"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/master
</code></pre>

And now I want to push and pull the dev branch to the github.

+Added those lines+
<pre><code>
[branch "dev"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/dev
</code></pre>
